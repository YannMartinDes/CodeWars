# CodeWars
This directory contains my solved exercises from the [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/) website in various programming languages.  

**Here's my [Codewar account](https://www.codewars.com/users/Mentra20)**  

You can find the statements of the exercises in the **Kata** tab (the files have the same name).  
_The lower the exercise's kyu, the more difficult it is._
